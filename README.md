To better support machine learning and other data science studies, the GPA developed a time-series configurable adapter for sending JSON-formatted communications to cloud-based service providers such as Microsoft Azure. This adapter includes customizable date, data, and meta-data formatting. The adapter has been tested using a real-time stream from about 80 PMUs (at 30 samples-per-second). The adapter is included with all GPA time-series products but is also available as a standalone service using Time-Series Library Cloud IO service.
